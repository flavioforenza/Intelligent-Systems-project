\subsection{Introduction}
In order to reduce the complexity in the analysis of a scene, a useful method 
is introduced to detect potential information, such as regions or 
objects, simultaneously. This method is called "\emph{Visual Saliency}". Before introducing
the topic, four types of concepts must be explained: (1)\emph{Fixations}: 
they concern the scene framed by the human eye. They are used to compare 
the methods of forecasting fixations. (2)\emph{ROI}: each region contains information, 
such as light or dark objects, which is intended to be separated.(3)\emph{Salient objects}: 
animals, people, cars etc. (4)\emph{Salient edges}: boundary of each object. The proposed 
method is based on carrying out a \emph{Salient Structure (SS) Detection},
useful for identifying the four previous properties, both in cluttered and 
simple scenes. The proposed framework is called \emph{CGVS (contour-guided visual 
search)}. This visual search tool identifies the targets using two types of 
paths: (1)\emph{selective path}: the boundaries of each object are detected, useful 
for estimating the position and size of the ROI: (2)\emph{non-selective path}: it 
can be properties such as color, luminary, texture etc. This search strategy 
carries out parallel processing on both paths, extracting global and local 
information. Finally, a Bayesian inference is applied to integrate the contour 
based spatial prior (CBSP), a useful method for extracting information on 
the boundaries, and local information in order to identify the salience of each 
pixel.
